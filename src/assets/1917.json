You aren&amp;#39;t going to pay d smarter throwing lots of big words in there. You do know that by 1916, England was conscripting people right? Yeah, those dudes that formed their own division or corps out of their neighborhood pub were not doing so in 1917 or 1918. By then, those people were being forced to fight. Why? Because people realized the horrors of the war.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","ups":2,"replies":[{"author":"Empty-Movie","text":"More trolling and it is inconsequential.
