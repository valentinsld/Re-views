Also, having seen Taxi Driver and basically consider it the most depressing movie on earth, I figured I probably wouldn't like it. Not to mention I have had some mental health issues in my past and that kind of scared me off of it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnyways, here's what I liked about it\n\n1. Joaquin Phoenix is just an intense actor and in this role that works out well. Arthur would be tough for nearly every actor to play but him he does it well. I can't say I like the character but he does a good job at showing how unstable the guy is. He isn't just pure crazy or on all the time. At his \"best\" Arthur is kind of an oddball but still has something off that makes it hard to relate, where as at his worst he lacks remorse and that's more like what crazy is like.\n2. I do like that it shows that in many cases the mentally ill are victimized like in the Subway. I'm reminded of bullying I witnessed in high school where often the victim had something wrong and others would take advantage (though those buttheads, much like the jerks in the movie probably had their own issues but could kind of hide it with affluence and some might argue they suffered from \"affluenza.\") \n3. I think this film does do a good job of showing how when one is beaten down, it feels like the world is after you and you'll literally do anything to improve your situation. I can understand that even with my minor mental illnesses, and even those without mental illness can relate especially if they've struggled to get ahead. Its damn near impossible to pull oneself out of a situation when it seems everyone and everything is against you, and in some ways there is a lot against a person like Arthur. Sadly of course people in these situations often turn to some pretty nasty crap. \n4. I liked the soundtrack. Its obvious that its trying for the most part to copy a Scorsese movie, but I liked having the oldies music. The scene of Arthur putting on makeup to \"That's Life\" was pretty good.\n5. I'm not typically a fan of gritty settings, but i thought the film did pretty well at showing the chaos of what a lot of large cities were like in the 80's. It doesn't quite capture what films of the 80's captured, but it works. \n6.  I like the idea that their could be \"copycat\" jokers as shown by the murder of the Waynes. I doubt this movie will be part of an extended cinematic universe, but if it were, I like the idea that there was an original Joker but even if he dies, his movement would live on\n\nWhat I didn't like:\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n1. The whole kill the rich thing is understandable and there is certainly that sentiment around today, but I doubt most people would be okay with someone murdering people even if they were jerks. I can understand people might not be sympathetic and to be honest those guys were jerks, but I doubt most people want random jerks dead simply because they were rich, at least deep down inside. Though maybe that's where we are as a society where we have politicians on both ends who use questionable rhetoric that seems similar to the protests in this film, and maybe that's the point, that such rhetoric is dangerous. The thing is people would be scared if  such rhetoric became true unless you are so far gone and you believe things are so bad you don't care anymore.\n2. The whole Thomas Wayne thing seemed a bit tacked on. We know his mom is crazy and all that, but I felt the whole idea that Thomas Wayne could be his father was a bit silly. The obsession makes sense because she worked for him and with how sick she was, it would make sense for her to be obsessed and think he was their only savior. I get that it was probably to show more of her illness and show similarities with her son, but it just seemed like poor writing.\n3. I thought the whole Robert De Niro talk show host idea was kind of weird, and if they were going to make such a character be a jerk, I would have made him more of like a David Letterman type late night host then a kind  Borsch Belt/Johnny Carson hybrid that De Niro was supposed to be. Maybe have a younger, more jerky actor play him and take inspiration from Letterman like when Dave had his conversations with cartoonist Harvey Pekar. Dave could be kind of a butt head and I certainly think someone more in the mold of him would have made fun of a guy like Arthur.\n4. Another thing with the De Niro character is that when Arthur appears with joker, he seems more confused than anything by this weirdo. Maybe that's an appropriate reaction for the type of character Murray Franklin was. Again though, I feel like it might have been better for Franklin to be more like a David Letterman type. Someone who'd know the guy is a freak and laugh at him at least until the Joker went too far.\n5. The whole Gary Glitter thing is just off kilter with the soundtrack. I know it fits with the 80's and maybe its meant to show his descent into further craziness, but when the soundtrack is mostly older music, the stair thing seems tone deaf. Same goes for \"White Room.\" I get that its supposed to evoke the chaos, but i'd  rather hear some Beastie Boys or Ramones or even some old school east coast rap to show the anarchy of the situation. White Room fits more with 60's anti-war protests then 80's chaos. Even something from the Rat Pack like \"You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You” would have been a good ironic choice. \n6. One last thing I didn't like is how he just goes straight psycho killer in the subway. Sure I can sympathize with him as those guys were jerks who assaulted him, but I feel like in that situation he wouldn't fire multiple times. He'd fire out of self defense. To me it would have been more powerful if there was an element of self defense. Maybe he tries to reason with the last guy he kills but the man punches back. You could even have Joker/Arthur go further towards madness when he sees that people want to \"kill the rich\" and it drives him towards his full transformation to the joker.\n\nOverall, I did like the film, but its hard to say I enjoy it. I felt it didn't have the best writing but Joaquin Phoenix makes it work well, and lifts the film up. Its a good thing you didn't have Jared Leto or a similar type actor play this role because then it would have easily bombed. \n\nIn regards to the mental illness, I think it does raise some good questions and has good points but overall, I think it still falls into the trope that the mentally ill are dangerous, even while showing a hint of the actual truth that many with mental illness are more likely to be victims. The thing is, mental illness didn't make Arthur into The Joker. If anything his mental illness was just a part of the whole character. I personally would have liked it if he was more of a troll or full on anarchist from the beginning rather than a person with an illness who just gives up. Maybe show him as someone for whom life is just a joke or uses humor to cope with his whole situation.","textHTML":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late to this movie, mostly because of the hubbub around its idea of mental illness and whether it does a good or bad job of portraying it.

I'm really not sure what else I was supposed to get out of the movie beyond that.

I guess not. Was that whole thing just planting the seeds for Joker 2? God I hope not.

You can have a film that's all about the atmosphere and cares only about evoking a certain kind of feeling through the score, characters, setting. You can have a plot driven film that doesn't need to think about the message because it keeps the audience engaged with what's happening to the characters and how the story will end. Joker is a character study. All scenes in the movie have Arthur in them and revolve around Arthur. All side characters are only important because of how they relate to Arthur. What you're saying would be a problem if the movie was trying to be a think piece but it's not. Joker is less concerned about the message and more concerned with getting us into Arthur's head and creating an emotional experience.\n\n&gt;...it would've made a lot more sense if it turned out that Thomas Wayne was indeed a rich asshole who exploited his power to ruin Penny's life, instead of a guy who was just mildly annoyed by his stalker...\n\nThrough smaller details (not responding to Penny's letters, his conversation with Arthur, the interview on TV) we see that he really is a \"rich asshole\". He's running for mayor to allegedly help the poor but he's completely disconnected from the real people of Gotham. He is aware of Penny's letters but never does anything to help her (doesn't even respond to her). Thinks of the people living in poverty as \"clowns\" that are somehow reponsible for their terrible living conditions. Tells Arthur that he is adopted and calls his mother crazy without thinking about the effect it could have on Arthur.

That's clearly not enough evidence so Arthur runs free. I think that when the police find Arthur dancing on the stairs they're already pretty sure it is him but even if not it still makes sense. Arthur kills 3 Wall Street guys but there were no witnesses that could identify him (it was already dark outside and he had a costume on). He also kills his mother (a weak old woman already in hospital after a stroke) and Randall (whose body is still lying in Arthur's apartment).

I’m not sure what the consensus is on it, but I like to spit out some thoughts while their raw before reading reviews / other people perspectives. First of: I really wish I watched this in the cinema, the movie looked great.\n\nJoachim Phoenix obviously did great and is by far the best part of this movie. I kind of have this ripe with actors playing “CRAZY” and I somewhat controversially think a lot of highly praised actors playing similar roles are extremely overrated. However, Phoenix just nails it. There so much subtility to his role, he’s mentally disturbed and not just an actor making funny faces.\n\nWith that said I feel like the movie is a little trapped between “art house” and a big studio movie. It’s at it’s best with those small, intimate scenes with Phoenix and at its worst with the riots and big budget stuff. I think my favorite scene is him dancing in that toilet after he killed those wall street guys. All that “Gotham” stuff feels a little out of place. Every Batman, Wayne, whatever scene are shoehorned in and doesn’t fit the movie. At all. The city clearly mirrors late 70s(?)-80s crime wave in NYC and at times I almost forgot that this wasn’t New York. Consequently, the whole “there’s garbage in the street, people are dying” stuff came off as a bit trite. I get that that’s the setting, but it felt very comic book-esq and in your face in a movie that kind of tries to be more. The whole hellhole city of rich vs poor, “they’re CLOWNS” and Gotham as a character on its own doesn’t really work that well, in my opinion. It’s not terrible or anything, just a little silly. The mental health facilities closing was a great and interesting look into how cities fail the weak and vulnerable, that would’ve been good enough.\n\nI don’t think every movie needs to have a message, I usually prefer very minimalistic films with not much of a story, but when the movie is clearly trying to “say” something like in this case, I would’ve been better to give it a little more focus. Just stick with the Phoenix stuff and his breakdown. I don’t know the intentions of the Philips, but if he wanted to tell a story of “society falling apart/eating its own” or something he didn’t really succeed as it just turned into \"a haha we’re crazy clowns rioting, this is how wayne died\" mess.
