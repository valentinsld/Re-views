Scott, New York Times**: “his malevolence is laced with melancholy, and there is a ghastly grandeur to his ambition.”\n\n**Todd McCarthy, Hollywood Reporter**: “Brolin's calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension.”\n\n**Matt Zoller Seitz, RogerEbert**: “I like how the movie builds everything around Brolin's CGI-assisted but still fully inhabited performance as Thanos—an oddly wistful and lonely figure who is, essentially, a religious fanatic, yet carries himself with the calm certainty of a military man who's read the ancient Greeks and speaks tenderly to cadets while stepping on their necks.”\n\n**Eric Kohn, IndieWire**: “Brolin gives the monstrous entity an air of eerie melancholy”\n\n**Owen Gleiberman, Variety**: “He’s like Hellboy, the Hulk, Darth Vader, and Oliver Stone rolled into one eloquent sociopath.”\n\n**Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair**: “saturnine and surprisingly compelling”\n\n**Peter Travers, Rolling Stone**: “Thunderously voiced by a dynamite Josh Brolin in a motion-capture performance that radiates ferocity and unexpected feeling”\n\n**Justin Chang, LA Times**: “Once you get past the impression that he's swallowed a giant purple boulder, Brolin makes Thanos a suitably authoritative, melancholy villain — someone who really does seem deluded enough to fancy himself a merciful deity rather than a mass murderer for the ages.”\n\n**Drew McWeeny, Nerdist**: “Josh Brolin’s Thanos emerges as the most fully-written bad guy any of the Marvel heroes have had to face, and I was surprised by how quickly the performance capture creation of Thanos stopped looking like an effect and started feeling like a performance.”\n\n**Peter Howell, The Star**: “Thanos has complicated motivations that put him on a par with Michael B. Jordan’s Erik Killmonger from Black Panther”\n\n**Mark Hughes, Forbes**: “Thanos could be the most fully realized villain in a comic book movie. I wasn’t prepared for the extent to which his character would get a strong and complex arc of his own. And the trailers do not do justice to the artistic rendering of his character in the film — anyone who thought he looked like a video game character in the trailers is in for a shock when they see the full movie. Trust me, you aren't prepared for how well he's written and portrayed here.”\n\n**Scott Mendelson, Forbes**: “a fine antagonist, even if he's not quite as sexy/fun as the last few MCU baddies”\n\n**Nick Schrager, The Daily Beast**: “If he lacks the scene-stealing charisma of Michael B. Jordan’s recent Black Panther baddie Killmonger, he exudes a heavyhearted menace that’s made more unnerving by his clearly articulated, wholly insane justifications for his mission”\n\n**Alonso Duralde, The Wrap**: “If there’s one disappointment here, it’s Thanos as a villain, and that’s not in any way Brolin’s fault. […] The character is more fearsome by his actions than in his dialogue, and his intent to wipe out trillions of living creatures gets subsumed by his chill demeanor. It’s like how Earth gets wiped out because of a bureaucratic error in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, only that bit of banal destruction was meant to be a joke. […] It also doesn’t help that Avengers: Infinity War can’t seem to make up its mind about how powerful Thanos is.”\n\n**Sam Adams, Slate**: “the movie plays fast and loose with how strong they make Thanos at any given moment”\n\n**Mike Ryan, Uproxx**: “Thanos feels like a tough character to pull off in the sense of, “let’s give him some sympathetic ideas,” but Joe and Anthony Russo sure try their best and get awfully close. If nothing else, Thanos does feel like a real character instead of just a purple bad guy – and even if we are probably never going to walk away thinking, You know, he had some interesting ideas, at least we get a sense of, Okay, his reasoning is bad, but at least we know where he’s coming from now.”\n\n**Molly Freeman, ScreenRant**: “Infinity War offers a valiant effort to develop his character so as not to fall into the underdeveloped Marvel villain trap. However, with so much else going on and so many other characters sharing the screen, Thanos still fails to be a fully developed and sympathetic antagonist.”\n\n**Josh Spiegel, SlashFilm**: “Whatever problems this movie has lie separate from almost all of the performances. All except the big one: Josh Brolin as Thanos. Brolin, to be fair, is fine as the literal Big Bad. For the first time, an MCU movie attempts to flesh out this character hell-bent on galactic genocide; unfortunately, Brolin’s firm motion-capture performance can’t hide the feeling that even now, Thanos is a dull, one-dimensional baddie.”\n\n**Kaila Hale-Stern, The Mary Sue**: \"I don’t know about Thanos being the best villain in the MCU’s history, as the Russos kept insisting. I think Killmonger and Loki still get to share that crown. Thanos is certainly more nuanced than many of Marvel’s villains, although he seems to flash back and forth from “sad dad” to “genocidal maniac” enough that you get whiplash. Josh Brolin does what he can, but it’s a damned shame about his CGI chin. Still, they’ve certainly made for a memorable character.\"\n\n**Bryan Bishop, The Verge**: “The prospect of a giant purple computer-generated bad guy has prompted some skepticism, but in context, the character is wonderfully effective. The visual effects undeniably capture the nuances of Brolin’s facial tics and mannerisms, allowing the actor to shine through all the CGI wizardry. It’s a good thing that it works so well, because Thanos is not the cardboard cutout villain that some previous Marvel bad guys have been. His master plan involves destroying half the universe, but in his own mind, his motivations are noble. He thinks he’s the hero of his story, and while nobody is going to agree with his tactics, his backstory does give his overall reasoning a perverse sort of logic. At several key moments in the film, Thanos nearly becomes a sympathetic character — even while he is doing truly horrific, unforgivable things. The biggest surprise of all may be that the most outlandish-looking Marvel villain is also its most complex and layered one, which simply wouldn’t be possible without the film’s synthesis of script, direction, performance, and visual effects.”\n\n**Angie Han, Mashable**: “Thanos leaves something to be desired.

Jordan’s Erik Killmonger from Black Panther”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Hughes, Forbes&lt;/strong&gt;: “Thanos could be the most fully realized villain in a comic book movie. I wasn’t prepared for the extent to which his character would get a strong and complex arc of his own. And the trailers do not do justice to the artistic rendering of his character in the film — anyone who thought he looked like a video game character in the trailers is in for a shock when they see the full movie. Trust me, you aren&amp;#39;t prepared for how well he&amp;#39;s written and portrayed here.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott Mendelson, Forbes&lt;/strong&gt;: “a fine antagonist, even if he&amp;#39;s not quite as sexy/fun as the last few MCU baddies”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nick Schrager, The Daily Beast&lt;/strong&gt;: “If he lacks the scene-stealing charisma of Michael B. Jordan’s recent Black Panther baddie Killmonger, he exudes a heavyhearted menace that’s made more unnerving by his clearly articulated, wholly insane justifications for his mission”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alonso Duralde, The Wrap&lt;/strong&gt;: “If there’s one disappointment here, it’s Thanos as a villain, and that’s not in any way Brolin’s fault. […] The character is more fearsome by his actions than in his dialogue, and his intent to wipe out trillions of living creatures gets subsumed by his chill demeanor. It’s like how Earth gets wiped out because of a bureaucratic error in The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, only that bit of banal destruction was meant to be a joke. […] It also doesn’t help that Avengers: Infinity War can’t seem to make up its mind about how powerful Thanos is.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sam Adams, Slate&lt;/strong&gt;: “the movie plays fast and loose with how strong they make Thanos at any given moment”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mike Ryan, Uproxx&lt;/strong&gt;: “Thanos feels like a tough character to pull off in the sense of, “let’s give him some sympathetic ideas,” but Joe and Anthony Russo sure try their best and get awfully close. If nothing else, Thanos does feel like a real character instead of just a purple bad guy – and even if we are probably never going to walk away thinking, You know, he had some interesting ideas, at least we get a sense of, Okay, his reasoning is bad, but at least we know where he’s coming from now.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Molly Freeman, ScreenRant&lt;/strong&gt;: “Infinity War offers a valiant effort to develop his character so as not to fall into the underdeveloped Marvel villain trap. However, with so much else going on and so many other characters sharing the screen, Thanos still fails to be a fully developed and sympathetic antagonist.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Josh Spiegel, SlashFilm&lt;/strong&gt;: “Whatever problems this movie has lie separate from almost all of the performances. All except the big one: Josh Brolin as Thanos. Brolin, to be fair, is fine as the literal Big Bad. For the first time, an MCU movie attempts to flesh out this character hell-bent on galactic genocide; unfortunately, Brolin’s firm motion-capture performance can’t hide the feeling that even now, Thanos is a dull, one-dimensional baddie.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kaila Hale-Stern, The Mary Sue&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;quot;I don’t know about Thanos being the best villain in the MCU’s history, as the Russos kept insisting. I think Killmonger and Loki still get to share that crown. Thanos is certainly more nuanced than many of Marvel’s villains, although he seems to flash back and forth from “sad dad” to “genocidal maniac” enough that you get whiplash. Josh Brolin does what he can, but it’s a damned shame about his CGI chin. Still, they’ve certainly made for a memorable character.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bryan Bishop, The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;: “The prospect of a giant purple computer-generated bad guy has prompted some skepticism, but in context, the character is wonderfully effective. The visual effects undeniably capture the nuances of Brolin’s facial tics and mannerisms, allowing the actor to shine through all the CGI wizardry. It’s a good thing that it works so well, because Thanos is not the cardboard cutout villain that some previous Marvel bad guys have been. His master plan involves destroying half the universe, but in his own mind, his motivations are noble. He thinks he’s the hero of his story, and while nobody is going to agree with his tactics, his backstory does give his overall reasoning a perverse sort of logic. At several key moments in the film, Thanos nearly becomes a sympathetic character — even while he is doing truly horrific, unforgivable things. The biggest surprise of all may be that the most outlandish-looking Marvel villain is also its most complex and layered one, which simply wouldn’t be possible without the film’s synthesis of script, direction, performance, and visual effects.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angie Han, Mashable&lt;/strong&gt;: “Thanos leaves something to be desired. Infinity War hints at surprising depths for its biggest of big bads, but never quite gets around to completing the full picture. At least not in this movie.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brian Truitt, USA Today&lt;/strong&gt;: “...an outstanding antagonist and the best computer-generated baddie to date of any superhero film.
