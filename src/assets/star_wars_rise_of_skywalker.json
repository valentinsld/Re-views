Sure, there were some mistakes, such as lightsaber mechanics with Finn being sliced up the back with a lightsaber and not dying, also Kylo Reb being sliced across the face and not having any permanent effects of that, but I thought those could easily be explained in the next movie.\n\nThe Last Jedi seriously let me down, however. The whole movie was just “here, have some impressive CGI and no actual fight choreography or plot or characters”. They just absolutely ruined Luke’s character. In the OT, he was the selfless orphan thrown into a war and used all of his abilities to do what he thought was right. He believed so much that Vader still had good in his in ROTJ, that he refused to kill him, even under the threat of death. In TLJ, he got scared of a dream vision and tried to murder a kid in his sleep. That’s not Luke’s character at all. It just pained me to watch that scene. Also, the disrespect Luke showed for the lightsaber was appalling. It takes a trained force user to craft a lightsaber, and it’s not an easy process. Instead, he throws it away like a stick. Even Mark Hamill said that he hated the movie for what they did. \n\nStill on TLJ, they turned Kylo from a cool villain that could have eventually been redeemed (which seemed like the case in TFA), into a whiny baby. I get it, Sith are supposed to use anger, but he was a knight of ren, not a Sith, so it made no sense for him to continually throw temper tantrums. \n\nFinn’s character development also completely shut down in this movie, other than him becoming “the token funny black guy”. He had an interesting setup in TFA, being the first stormtrooper in a movie to ever take off their helmet, not counting clones. It was also hinted that he was force sensitive, with him being able to hear the screams when Coruscant was attacked. All of that was just thrown away in the movie.\n\nRey’s powers make zero sense either. She has zero training whatsoever, other than standing by a rock and playing with a lightsaber like it’s a toy. But suddenly, she’s able to take on a room full of specially trained guards, and beat Kylo in a battle waged completely with force power. Anakin had a midi-chlorian count so high, even Yoda had less than him, and he still needed training to become that powerful. And Luke got training as well. He got some training from Yoda, but not much. He then went and fought Vader and lost. He went back and trained under Yoda for months, or even years, cane back and fought Vader and won. He had to work for his power. Rey put in zero work and did all that cool stuff because feminism. Honestly, if you want strong female Jedi, watch a couple of clone wars episodes, not this.\n\nThe lightsaber fights were awful, with bad choreography and they carried zero emotional weight behind them, unlike the prequels or the OT. Also, they killed off who should have been the main villain of the franchise, Snoke. This movie was a pretty large mess, the only good factor the CGI. Don’t even get me started on the physics of bombs falling in space however.\n\nThe Rise of Skywalker was not godforsaken when you consider what a mess TLJ was, but I would never call it a good movie. The entire movie was just retconning the series. Rey finally got some training, Chewie became relevant instead of just being the Uber for the main crew, and a main villain was revealed, despite being a stupid one. \n\nLet me start with Kylo and Rey’s “connection”. They had a force bond in this series, which was when two force users can see each other through the force. But something has to happen to them to be able to create one. They never went through anything together in order to create one, unlike Revan and Bastila (any self-respecting fan should know those two). The whole force bond just doesn’t make sense, because they never were in any situation to create a bond. And let me talk about the force healing they use, oh ho ho. NO. The way they used force healing is not how it works. Force healing is only used for minor injuries, and it costs a great deal of pain for the person healing. Force healing is used only a couple times during the movies before this, one being Ben Kenobi healing Luke when he was passed out in episode four. If force healing could be used to heal mortal wounds, then why are Qui-Gon and Vader dead? Guess the Jedi haven’t unlocked that skill yet. Also, why not throw in some resurrection while we’re at it? I think I can say that Ren isn’t a night sister or Darth Plagueis the wise (have you ever heard his tragedy). So, none of these powers make sense, and they were only added for plot armor and a half-hearted romance subplot.\n\nThe amount of side-characters they threw into this movie was ridiculous, as well as the zero backstory that they gave them. Rose, whatever Poe’s past girlfriend’s name was, and the stormtrooper deserters, were thrown in and had zero development. \n\nI’m honestly just getting tired talking about this movie, so let’s skip all the nonsense that happened and go to the final battle on Exegol. What the heck was this. Just a fleet of starships, hidden in a planet that no one in the galaxy could find, until they did? The space battle felt rushed and not very exciting, but the real whoopsie here was Palpatine vs Rey and Ben. Oh, sure, we can now pull lightsabers out of the void like Harry Potter. The fight was not choreographed well, and Palpatine just repeatedly doing his “strike me down” irked me. The whole congregation of Sith was stupid, because before the rule of two, they were known for killing each other and getting in the way. Also, lightsabers themselves now have the power to deflect lightning other than just being swords made out of pure heat that only skilled force users can make. “I am all the Jedi”, how, where is that written? Is she really the chosen one, no, no she isn’t. That’s stupid and made me want to throw up. Anakin was the chosen one. \n\nI’m sorry, this really sort of turned into a rant at the end. I just did not like the sequel trilogy, because it started off promising, then ended up kicking all the other Star Wars lore off a cliff, because Anakin is no longer relevant. IMO, this movie series is badly written fanfiction, and I am sticking to Legends as canon. \n\nNow, I’m not saying you can’t enjoy these movies, that perfectly okay. But, there is a line between enjoying a movie and a good movie, and in no way do I consider this a good movie.","textHTML":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I consider myself a “Star Wars fan”, which could probably be taken in so many different ways these days.

He inevitably runs them into the ground. He is demonstrably guilty of throwing in too much ‘splosions, noises, running, quippy dialogue during certain-death situations (usually yelled between running characters while surrounded by ‘splosions and loud noises), asking questions that are never answered, and engaging in shallow two-bit navel gazing that I’d expect out of a stoner taking Philosophy 101. He shouldn’t be the guy you ask to *start* a franchise because he isn’t the guy you ask to *end* a franchise. Giving him the golden opportunity (from his perspective) to ask a thousand questions and walk away only yokes the next guy with the burden of dealing with them.

He inevitably runs them into the ground. He is demonstrably guilty of throwing in too much ‘splosions, noises, running, quippy dialogue during certain-death situations (usually yelled between running characters while surrounded by ‘splosions and loud noises), asking questions that are never answered, and engaging in shallow two-bit navel gazing that I’d expect out of a stoner taking Philosophy 101. He shouldn’t be the guy you ask to &lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt; a franchise because he isn’t the guy you ask to &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; a franchise.

IMO TLJ didn't necessarily ruin that, either. For instance, the hate/hate but, what would've been a weirdly codependent and fun-to-watch relationship between Kylo and Hux. Where could that have gone, I wonder, with Hux constantly seeking to stick a knife into Kylo's back, against Kylo's volatile ruthlessness? How about Finn, so intriguing as the Stormtrooper who broke programming? How about a film that brought in a NEW villain - because Snoke probably didn't work in a vacuum. Even some creepy council would've done. Knights of Ren (got so excited by the TROS trailer shot). How about, yah know, Rey actually killing Chewie? How about leaving Rey as a nobody, 'coz wwwwwaaaaaaay back, and even in TLJ, isn't the Force an \"energy, binding the galaxy together?\" (I don't remember Obi-Wan or Yoda saying \"but we only let the little buggers into Jedi school if, yah know, they come from royal blood and parents can cough up the tuition. Someone's gotta pay for the fireproof laser sword training gym.\")\n\nThe other thing too, is, IMO Disney is targeting the UPCOMING generation, and being on the younger end of the scale, a 6-year old isn't going to be too picky about a lack of character depth, or the impossibility of any remnant of any Death Star being left over, or the absurdity of navigating 150 foot waves with no sailing experience (dressed in a light bathing suit cover-up), or the introduction of a magic dagger - plenty of cartoons have cool stuff that just shows up, plus characters bouncing from scene to scene. \n\nIf the question is, why does Abrams (or Michael Bay) keep getting work - well, the skill pool to handle a large budget film safely and deliver on time probably isn't that big, to begin with.
