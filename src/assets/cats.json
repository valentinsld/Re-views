Then again, they were paid so not even that. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#39;t mean to shit on this film, I haven&amp;#39;t watched it but I&amp;#39;ve seen reviews and I&amp;#39;ve seen the trailer and I know the cast. It&amp;#39;s just not looking good, and there&amp;#39;s nothing I like about it. Aside from the fact that I&amp;#39;m just curious at this point to see just how bad it really is.
