But I think it is fair to consider it a companion piece to Inception. It shares many traits with Inception and/or other Christopher Nolan films. These include, in no particular order:!&lt;\n\n* &gt;!playing with the concept of time and narrative chronology!&lt;\n* &gt;!a hallway fight that demonstrates the central \"gimmick\" of the movie!&lt;\n* &gt;!characters  talking about their backstory, interspersed with very brief flashbacks  showing us what they're saying (really leaning into the \"flash\" in  flashback)!&lt;\n* &gt;!lifestyles of the rich and famous!&lt;\n* &gt;!men in tailored suits and slicked back hair!&lt;\n* &gt;!men in masks, making it difficult to understand what they're saying (although it's not as bad in Tenet as Bane in TDKR before they went and adjusted his sound mix)!&lt;\n* &gt;!an, at times, overpowering soundscape (music and sound design)!&lt;\n* &gt;!my cocaine!&lt;\n* &gt;!a  dearth of female characters (I counted four women with speaking lines,  three of whom are there for exposition, and only two of whom have any  significant screen time)!&lt;\n* &gt;!the  central emotional throughline (such as it is) expressed primarily by  the main female character through her relationship with the main  character!&lt;\n* &gt;!elaborate  heists, or heist-like action set pieces featuring planes, cars, trucks  and automatic weapons - nothing is ever simple in a Nolan movie!&lt;\n* &gt;!a dash of metafiction!&lt;\n* &gt;!an opening sequence that serves as an audition of sorts!&lt;\n* &gt;!the idea of death being an escape out of an alternate reality (not really the major plot point in Tenet that it was in Inception, but it comes into play early on for a bit)!&lt;\n\n&gt;!There are undoubtedly more recurring motifs, but these are the main ones I noticed.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!As the above list might suggest, Tenet  felt familiar. Nolan clearly likes to play with his toys, and is  fascinated with the concept of time, whether it be in a non-fantastical  genre (Memento, Dunkirk) or science fiction (Inception, Interstellar). His narrative structures are often complex, even convoluted, to illustrate his films' premise. That's certainly true of Tenet, and not unusual in a story involving time travel.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!But I think Tenet  ends up being too clever (or silly) for its own good. The \"gimmick\" in  the story is expressed through the conceit of \"inverted\" objects,  objects sent back in time and which - upon arrival - somehow run  backwards in contravention to normal entropy. So a bullet might leave a  hole in a glass before it's fired. Or a car might find itself flipped on  a road before it's flipped. It's a conceit that feels like one you  could just maybe get away with in a Golden Age or Silver Age era comic  book. But in a story that, like most Nolan movies, is ostensibly  grounded in reality (something that was one of the defining aspects of  his Batman movies for instance), it just doesn't come across as  plausible. I think Nolan is aware of this, cause he lampshades it by  having a Doctor Exposition tell the main character (and us) that he (we)  shouldn't try to make sense of it. Which is advice I eventually took to  heart. Because the device I think is essentially only there to allow  Nolan to put an unusual spin the big action sequences.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!And  there are many action sequences, most of them heists of some sort, all  delivered in typical Nolan style: technically assured, eschewing visual  effects in favour of practical effects when possible (there's one  involving a Boeing 747 and I'm willing to bet that Nolan used a real  plane instead of CGI), but also sometimes confusing. There are two  sequences that suffered most in this last regard. One was the opening,  where I had some problems following the beats (something that was not an issue in other - better - Nolan opening heists, like the ones in The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises or even Inception).  The other was the climax, which quite frankly I thought was a mess.  Just hundreds of men running, yelling, shooting at things (not exactly  what) and blowing things up (or whatever the opposite is of blowing  things up in time-reversed action), while there was a \"B\" line following  two characters, and a \"C\" line following two more. There was even an  introductory briefing to the big climax (in fact, laying out the plan  before seeing it executed is a trope used multiple times in the film)  which is supposed to explain everything about the mission, like the fact  that there were two teams, one normal and one inverted. But ultimately,  this sequence just failed to cohere for me, and I watched with detached  interest at best, and boredom at worst.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!There  were other sequences where we revisit previous scenes from another  perspective. These were better handled, but the idea is one we've seen  before and so didn't come as a particular surprise (even the movie's  title serves as foreshadowing), whether in science fiction short stories  (eg Heinlein's \"All You Zombies\", later adapted as the movie Predestination), comic books (Alan Moore's Chronocops) or other movies (eg Back to the Future).  That, by the way, isn't a criticism - after all there are very few  original ideas left, and those sequences themselves worked pretty well.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!I  think Nolan is fascinated with the time travel gimmick mainly for its  own sake. But I wish he had used it to better tell either an emotional  story or a more thematic one. There are some nods at both in Tenet. Elizabeth Debicki's character carries the emotional weight of the story, but it feels detached from the main idea. And, like Inception, which based the different characters' roles in the team on key film making roles, there is a metafictional aspect to Tenet.  In this case it involves the question of who is the protagonist (rather  awkwardly actually put in those terms: \"I'm the protagonist of this  story\" is an actual line in the film). Either the emotional throughline  or the more conceptual metafictional question could have been better  integrated into the story, but both are lost in the storm und drang of  Nolan's action sequences and narrative complexity.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!There's  not a lot to say about the acting. Everyone is fine or better. Debicki  does as much as she can with what she's given, and Kenneth Branagh most  easily rises above the material. I've long thought that Branagh is at  his best when he's playing bad guys, whether he's hamming it up  shamelessly (Wild Wild West) or providing nuance, warmth and appeal to the most horrific of people (Conspiracy).  He's always watchable as a villain no matter how good, bad or mediocre  the surrounding movie. He gives the most entertaining performance in Tenet, investing even hoary cliches like \"If I can't have you, no one will\" with intensity, and is probably the best thing about it.!&lt;\n\n&gt;!Random  thoughts: the opening sequence seems inspired by the 2002 Moscow  terrorist hostage crisis, and one of the characters' homes, an Indian  billionaire, seems clearly modelled on this real-life home of an actual Indian billionaire.!&lt;","textHTML":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was basically my takeaway from the movie.

Tenet, my most hyped film of 2020 even before everything happened, and I finally saw it tonight.\n\nFirstly, this is a film where your brain has to be switched on 100% through the whole film, or else it'll be an impossible journey to follow. I tried my best to stay concentrated but honestly had trouble with following its story sometimes.\n\nTenet's midpoint is when the film starts to work. That's when everything flipped to make the rest of the movie make sense, it's when all of it clicked together and I could appreciate it. So if someone chooses to only watch the first half of the film, I don't think they'd really get Tenet.\n\nAlthough, I saw one of the twists coming, there were a lot of small twists and callbacks to the first half of the film that made me appreciate the characters and the story as a whole more. \n\nBut John David Washington's character is one of Nolan's weaker protagonists. He's two dimensional and less relatable, which I think comes from knowing so little about the character's personal life and so the stakes for the character, feel less personal. Robert Pattinson has a fun performance in the film.\n\nTenet's score by Ludwig Goransson and set pieces stand out but I found the cinematography to be more bland and generic, which made me even think \"is Nolan working with another DOP for the first time here\", so I had to google to double check it was Hoyt Van Hoytema.\n\nBut it's premise and story is ultimately, the strongest part about the film and makes Tenet feel \"Nolan\" with commentary about time that you can expect. It's premise is what makes the action scenes not be generic, although it feels gimmicky at times.\n\nOverall, it feels like it's less about the emotions or an \"experience\" this time around for a Nolan film. I think a second watch would make me appreciate the film more with its use of structure. Tenet made me hope that Nolan's next film moves away from heavily exploring time again but something fresh we haven't seen him tackle.\n\nMy Nolan ranking as of today:\nInterstellar/TDK/Inception &gt;\nFollowing/BB/Dunkirk &gt;\nThe Prestige/Memento &gt;\nTDKR/TENET &gt;\nInsomnia\n\nTenet as of today is a 7/10.","textHTML":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saw it here in Australia tonight and here are my thoughts.

He&amp;#39;s two dimensional and less relatable, which I think comes from knowing so little about the character&amp;#39;s personal life and so the stakes for the character, feel less personal. Robert Pattinson has a fun performance in the film.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tenet&amp;#39;s score by Ludwig Goransson and set pieces stand out but I found the cinematography to be more bland and generic, which made me even think &amp;quot;is Nolan working with another DOP for the first time here&amp;quot;, so I had to google to double check it was Hoyt Van Hoytema.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But it&amp;#39;s premise and story is ultimately, the strongest part about the film and makes Tenet feel &amp;quot;Nolan&amp;quot; with commentary about time that you can expect. It&amp;#39;s premise is what makes the action scenes not be generic, although it feels gimmicky at times.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, it feels like it&amp;#39;s less about the emotions or an &amp;quot;experience&amp;quot; this time around for a Nolan film. I think a second watch would make me appreciate the film more with its use of structure. Tenet made me hope that Nolan&amp;#39;s next film moves away from heavily exploring time again but something fresh we haven&amp;#39;t seen him tackle.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Nolan ranking as of today:\nInterstellar/TDK/Inception &amp;gt;\nFollowing/BB/Dunkirk &amp;gt;\nThe Prestige/Memento &amp;gt;\nTDKR/TENET &amp;gt;\nInsomnia&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Tenet as of today is a 7/10.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","ups":9,"replies":[{"author":"AltairLirorix","text":"There had been speculation that Tenet was intended as the first of a trilogy / franchise, is there any sense or indication of that or does the film seem complete by itself?","textHTML":"&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been speculation that Tenet was intended as the first of a trilogy / franchise, is there any sense or indication of that or does the film seem complete by itself?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;","ups":2,"replies":[{"author":"thesniffinaccountant","text":"Not OP but saw it tonight in Australia.
